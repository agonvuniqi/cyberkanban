# Cyber Kanban
This is CyberKanban. I use kanban quite often so figured I would give a shot at making my own version. Takes advantage of server side rendering with a twitter card validator for my favorite soccer team, Bayern Munich! Google auth was also enabled for access to the Kanban and routes were protected by auth gaurd. It was a lot of fun to make and it's hosted directly from firebase!

Designed for Desktop but works on mobile just as well!
