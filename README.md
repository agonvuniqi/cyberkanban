# Cyber Kanban
This is CyberKanban. 

It's solely built on Angular 9 and Firebase for data storage/hosting with Nest.js for server side rendering and Angular Universal for pre rendering. Server side rendering is showcases players from my favorite soccer team, Bayern Munich, which is also has a twitter card validator for easy sharing across platforms! I use kanban quite often for work so figured I would give a shot at making my own version. Google auth was also enabled for access to the Kanban and routes were protected by auth gaurd.

Designed for Desktop but works on mobile just as well!
